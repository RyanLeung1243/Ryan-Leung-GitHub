enjoy the website I made... the styling is a bit simple but i added some quirks

- marquee on the bottom
- hit enter when you search
- responsive webpage
- dropdown menu with links to other articles


Thanks for teaching us React and Ionic.
It has been a fun journey!

please keep in touch!
